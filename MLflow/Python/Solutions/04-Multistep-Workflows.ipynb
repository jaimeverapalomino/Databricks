With loading, ETL, featurization, training, and prediction stages--to name a few--the complexity of the process quickly grows.  One additional benefit is collaboration since different individuals can work on different stages in the pipeline.\n\n**Question:** How can I manage a pipeline using MLflow?  \n**Answer:** Multi-step workflows chain together multiple MLflow jobs.
