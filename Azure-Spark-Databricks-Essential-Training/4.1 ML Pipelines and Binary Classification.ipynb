algorithms like Logistic Regression, we will have to convert the categorical variables in the dataset into numeric variables.\nThere are 2 ways we can do this.\n\n* Category Indexing\n\n  This is basically assigning a numeric value to each category from {0, 1, 2, ...numCategories-1}.\n  This introduces an implicit ordering among your categories, and is more suitable for ordinal variables (eg: Poor: 0, Average: 1, Good: 2)\n\n* One-Hot Encoding\n\n  This converts categories into binary vectors with at most one nonzero value (eg: (Blue: [1, 0]), (Green: [0, 1]), (Red: [0, 0]))\n\nIn this dataset, we have ordinal variables like education (Preschool - Doctorate), and also nominal variables like relationship (Wife, Husband, Own-child, etc).\nFor simplicity's sake, we will use One-Hot Encoding to convert all categorical variables into binary vectors.\nIt is possible here to improve prediction accuracy by converting each categorical column with an appropriate method.\n\nHere, we will use a combination of [StringIndexer] and [OneHotEncoderEstimator] to convert the categorical variables.\nThe `OneHotEncoderEstimator` will return a [SparseVector].\n\nSince we will have more than 1 stages of feature transformations, we use a [Pipeline] to tie the stages together.\nThis simplifies our code.\n\n[StringIndexer]:
